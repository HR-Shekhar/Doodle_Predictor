# üñçÔ∏è Doodle Classifier

A fun and efficient machine learning app that classifies your doodle into one of the 19 pre-defined classes using a trained deep learning model.

## üöÄ Project Overview

This project is built using a subset of the [Google Quick, Draw! Dataset](https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/quickdraw_dataset/full/numpy_bitmap). It allows users to draw or upload a doodle and get real-time predictions via a trained DNN model. The entire ML pipeline ‚Äî from data sampling to model training and deployment ‚Äî is included in this repository.

The goal was to build a scalable ML-powered doodle recognition tool with modular notebooks and a clean deployment-ready Streamlit interface.

## üóÉÔ∏è Dataset

- **Source**: [Google Quick, Draw! Numpy Bitmap Dataset](https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/quickdraw_dataset/full/numpy_bitmap)
- **Classes Used**: 19 (custom-selected from the full set of 345)
- **Samples**: 30,000 samples per class (570,000 total)

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Download full class `.npy` files manually via the link above or search _"Google Quick, Draw! Dataset"_ and use the custom script in `doodle_sampling.ipynb` to extract samples.

## üìä Notebooks Explained

### `doodle_sampling.ipynb`

- Loads raw `.npy` files of selected classes.
- Samples 30,000 examples from each.
- Provides visualization using matplotlib.
- Saves sampled datasets for model training.

### `doodle_model.ipynb`

- Loads and combines all sampled classes.
- Preprocesses the data (reshaping, normalizing, labeling).
- Trains a Deep Neural Network.
- Evaluates and saves the model.

## üåê Web App

### `app.py`

- Streamlit app to predict doodles from user input.
- Minimal UI for clean interaction.
- Hosted locally or on platforms like Hugging Face Spaces.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

### 1. Clone the repository


git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/doodle-classifier.git
cd doodle-classifier


### 2. Setup the environment

pip install -r requirements.txt

‚ö†Ô∏è Important:
Do not modify packages.txt or change the structure/content of requirements.txt unless you're sure the versions are compatible with Streamlit and TensorFlow. These are configured for compatibility and Hugging Face deployment.


### 3. ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the App

streamlit run app.py

If you‚Äôre deploying on Hugging Face Spaces or another cloud platform, make sure to include the model file in the appropriate directory.
